This is a bash script that can batch generate .png/.jpg files at various sizes based on a configuration file. The idea is to have source image files at a large scale, and use this tool to quickly generate various versions of the images (including 2x retina versions) at any sizes required for responsive image delivery on the web.

Documentation and installation instructions are available on [the project wiki](https://github.com/philsinatra/Sourcesetr/wiki).
